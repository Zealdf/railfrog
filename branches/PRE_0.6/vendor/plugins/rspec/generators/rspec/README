This directory contains the sources for RSpec on Rails,
which is a set of extensions to RSpec to port fixtures
and other common Rails testing features to RSpec.

There is also a set of generators for setting up a Rails
project for RSpec and generate spec skeletons.

Please refer to the Documentation on the website:

http://rspec.rubyforge.org/tools/rails.html

Or if you've checked this out from Subversion, also
read the README under the rails app for instructions
on how to run from source.
